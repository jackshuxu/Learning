        <dt>Bob</dt>
        <dd class="odd">
          According to Revelation X; The "Bob" Apocryphon, "Bob" was born in
          Dallas, Texas, to Xinucha-Chi-Xan M. Dobbs (a pharmacist) and Jane
          McBride Dobbs. At an early age, he possessed a talent for making large
          amounts of money by playing the stock market over the telephone. He
          married his wife Constance "Connie" Marsh in Las Vegas in 1955 and
          worked as a photographer's model while inventing and patenting novelty
          gag items. In 1957, he worked weekends doing Evangelical Christian
          preaching "strictly for the money"

        <dd class="even">
          Constance "Connie" Marsh Dobbs, the wife of "Bob", has become nearly
          as legendary in SubGenius circles as "Bob". Although "Bob" has been
          married to other women, spirits, deities, and inanimate objects,
          Connie is described in the SubGenius documentary Arise! as "his first,
          and still his primary wife." Connie, an actress and model who formed
          the Home for Slackless Children is the patron of SubGenius women, and
          she is seen as a vision of true liberation for women. She refuses to
          submit to anyone (especially "Bob"). She is just as free-wheeling and
          promiscuous as her husband, although she has a more level head on her
          shoulders when it comes to domestic issues. Connie has been described
          as the "brains" of the couple who wrote at a 4th grade level when in
          1st and grade and let "Bob" copy her homework when they were children.
          She is also said to be a shapeshifter who celebrated her 100th
          birthday, and sang, danced, and spoke, at a gathering in 2022.

        <dt>Dobbstown</dt>
        <dd class="odd">
          According to Church lore, "Bob" and "Connie" travelled to Sarawak,
          Malaysia, and founded his headquarters, a secret enclave there, called
          Dobbstown, where he often stays.

        <dt>Sacred Ikon</dt>
        <dd class="even">
          Around 2002, the Church adopted a new symbol called the "Sacred Ikon",
          which is a stylized cross consisting of three bars and a pipe, placed
          in a pattern that matches the eyes, nose, mouth, and pipe of "Bob"'s
          image.
